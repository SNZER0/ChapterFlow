ChapterFlow - Focus Timer
A visually stunning, Pomodoro-style focus timer designed to help you track progress and achieve your goals, one chapter at a time. ChapterFlow combines a beautiful "glassmorphism" interface with practical features to create an effective and enjoyable productivity tool.

âœ¨ Features
Pomodoro Timer: A classic timer with three modes to structure your workflow:

Focus (default: 25 mins)

Short Break (default: 5 mins)

Long Break (default: 15 mins)

Chapter Progress Tracker: Set a total number of chapters (or tasks) and visually track your progress as you complete focus sessions.

Customizable Durations: Easily adjust the length of focus, short break, and long break sessions via the settings panel.

Persistent Memory: The app uses your browser's localStorage to remember your custom timer durations and chapter progress between sessions.

Stunning UI:

A sleek glass-effect design that's modern and easy on the eyes.

A beautiful, subtly animated gradient background.

Smooth transitions and hover effects for a premium feel.

Fully Responsive: The layout adapts perfectly to any screen size, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

Audio Notifications: A simple, pleasant sound alerts you when a timer session is complete.

Keyboard Shortcuts: Control the timer with your keyboard for maximum efficiency (Space to start/pause, R to reset).
